    "text": "HTC Parking & Security B.V. is the European market leader in Speedgates. Speed u200B or u200B gates are folding gates that respond to incoming and outgoing traffic with sensors. The purpose of these fences is to offer safety and speed to customers. HTC Parking & Security is mainly concerned with the speed gates. In addition, they sometimes also deal with normal fencing and barriers. Currently their market consists of 90% the Netherlands and Belgium, and 10% foreign customers.What makes HTC Parking & Security so special is that they develop, produce and, when possible, install the speed gates themselves. At the site in Waddinxveen, the fencing is erected by specialized staff from the ground. All other employees are also at the same location. Within HTC, they use the Lean method, which means that constant waste is removed from their processes. They themselves are very enthusiastic about their R&D department, which is constantly working on better quality for the Customer.\nHTC describes itself as a flat organization. There are indeed roles such as a director and managers, but they see this more as a collaboration."
